In my Tip Calculator i also add an extra Text field that let the user put how many persons are going to pay the bill, 
then the App calculate how many each person have to pay and display it. It also calculate how many each person has to tip.

Notes:

This is my first time programming in Swift and also creating an app therefore it was kind of challenging to acomplish this project,
After a lot of searching in the internet i were able to complete the app thanks to the help i find in the internet and the experience 
already aquired from programming in C and Java. I Hope i get choose to participate in the class so i get more experience in this great 
Language/ Program. I Hope you like my app!!.
