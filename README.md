This repository is for my projects

My name is Cristian Melendez and i am 20 years old. I am a Computer Engineer student in fourth year in the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus. Planning on changing from Computer Engineer department to Software Engineer department due to my love and passion for programming and working with software. Fast learner and always looking to learn new things, i hope you enjoy my projects.
